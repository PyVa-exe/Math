# Math
 It's a library in baabnq for basic calculating


If you want to use this library, you have to go into your directory of your compiler and intepreter and create a folder.
After that, you have to download the code and paste the Math.baabnq in the directory CODE/LIBRARY into the folder
you just created. In your Baabnq program, just use the 'use (dir/filename)' to use this library.
But if you want to learn how this library works instead download the code and go into the folder CODE/EXPLANATION. 
You will find a file called Math.baabnq in this folder. This file is the library, but with comments for you to 
understand the code.
