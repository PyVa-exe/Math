# Math
 It's a library in baabnq for basic calculating


If you want to use this library, you have to go into your directory of your compiler and intepreter.
After that, you have to download the code and paste the Math.baabnq in the directory CODE/LIBRARY into the folder
you just created. In your Baabnq program, just use the '"use (Math.baabnq)' to use this library.
But if you want to learn how this library works instead download the code and go into the folder CODE/EXPLANATION. 
You will find a file called Math.baabnq in this folder. This file is the library, but with comments for you to 
understand the code.
