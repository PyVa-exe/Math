# Math
 It's a library in baabnq for basic math

download Baabnq Compiler: https://www.github.com/PyVa-exe/Baabnq-Compiler/
download S1monsAssembly3_Intepreter: https://www.github.com/PyVa-exe/S1monsAssembly_Intepreter-v3/

If you want to use this library, you have to go into your directory of your compiler and intepreter and
then download the code and paste the file Math.baabnq in the directory CODE/LIBRARY into the same directory as the intepreter
and the compiler are. In your Baabnq program, just use the '"use Math.baabnq' to use this library.
But if you want to learn how this library works instead download the code and go into the folder CODE/EXPLANATION. 
You will find a file called Math.baabnq in this folder. This file is the library, but with comments for you to 
understand the code.
